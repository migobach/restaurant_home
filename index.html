    <h1>The Angry Concious Coffee Hovel</h1>
    <h2>Your home away from home</h2>
    <p>Hipster's Coffee is situated in the hippest spot you don't know about. That is why it is so hip. Notice our contact information? Probably not, that is becuase you cannot contact us. Instead, you need to learn about us from other hipsters. Once you find us, we know you will be converted to our special roasts, blends, and vegan, gluten-fee, fair trade, ethically sourced, organic, non-GMO, pesticide-free, fat-free, trans-fat-free, cholestoral-free, paleo menu.</p>

  <div class="welcome">
    <h3>Welcome to the hipest place around</h3>
    <p>Hipster coffee shop prides itself in being so cool, it is isn't even cool. Last we heard, nobody knew anything about it, and therefore, it is the most exclusive location you don't know about. We were even featured in an episode of Portlandia, however, that show isn't even that hip relative to us. We have ample bike parking in front, however, we don't believe in gears and therefore bike riders not on a fixie will be asked to park elsewhere. Preferably in a parking garage, since their bikes are basically vehicles. Much like our beleifs regarding bikes, we welcome those of every background, unless you are conservative. Welcome! We are excited you found our website! It is so exclusive, you have to go on our nascent developers GitHub page to even find out that we exist!</p>

      <p>This is what our interior looks like. Now, figure out where we are. We stay exclusive by staying elusive. The fact that you found our custom website made by professional developer, frelancer, activist, and philanthropist vegan yogi Michael Bach means you are one step closer to finding the worst pastriesendorsed by the World Wildlife Foundation.</p>
